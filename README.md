#Executive Overview
WITS is a consortium of software that helps the user understand *why* the blizzard of files on their machines are there, as well as for ensuring the integrity of them.

#Rationale
Within about one hour of my odyssey in dealing with computers started, commenced the problem of managing the collection of files and directories that infest them.  Whether I am dealing with a single machine or an entire flock of them, I want to know WITS!  Basically, for each file, I want to know why it's there.

The reason these files exist is because somebody has ideas that they want to implement.  Unfortunately some of these ideas are goals of other people, frequently with unsavory intent, such as marketers, spies, and hackers.   How can we collect and record the information about all these files and ideas, connect them together, and determine specific issues to deal with?   That is the challenge that the WITS consortium addresses.

The essence of the WITS solution is to build a database containing information about the various files and ideas involved, as well as their relationships.  These relationships come in all shapes and sizes and link the files and ideas together.

As the information about the files and ideas is discovered, organized, and clarified, certain issues will emerge.  These issues are specific things that ought to be done, such as determine the purpose of a specific file.  This is the foundation of providing the “why” for the existence of each file.  This step is somewhat easier said than done and we will encounter devils in the details as we develop this further.

WITS gives you the ability to ignore the details below a certain level in a file-system.  So for example your model might mention that “/etc” exists due to the idea of “My Ubuntu installation” while ignoring the blizzard of details within.  With WITS you can quickly outline the forest, but refine your view of the trees at your leisure.

Once the WITS infrastructure is in place, it becomes rather easy to address other issues standing nearby.  For example, in addition to merely knowing the “reason” for the existence of the various files, we may also be interested in questions of file integrity, security, backup, and periodic review.  These issues and more become more tractable once the WITS infrastructure is in place.
